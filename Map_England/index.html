            <h2>Map of England and Wales</h2>
            <p>This first map shows a map of England and Wales for the period 2017 including major known cities around the country. You can sort between different maps to show the overall average across the country or averages for specific types of housing such as Detached or Semi-Detached. </p><p>Detached housing is considered to be a standalone house while Semi-Detached is considered to be a house that has two seperate homes within the housing seperated by a wall. Terraced housing is considered to be mulptiple homes connected together in a row, while flats are self contained homes found within complexes. Other includes any other type of home that does not fall in any of these categories</p>

          <h2>Map of London</h2>
          <p>London is the most expensive place found within the UK with average housing prices for some property types ranging up to 15,000,000 pounds. A new scale is need to properly show the range of average housing prices as places in the heart of the mega city do not have an average price less 1,000,000 pound while locations on the outside of the city have housing as cheap as 290,000 pounds.</p>
          <p>One thing to note about this map is that it does not consider the size of the housing purchased so while some hosuing may be cheaper than others it is likely that the size of the housing could be considerably smaller to the more expsensive property type.</p>
          <p>It also understandable why some housing is considerably more expensive to other housing as Detached home in the City of London would be a rare sight where flats in the City of London would be easy to come by.</p>
